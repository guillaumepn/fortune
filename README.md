# fortune
I love having FORTUNE(6) run on my login-shell and configuring cookies myself. I cannot find a non-personal collection of topic-specific fortune cookies. So here it is.

A script to add the as well as a custom collection file to run after download shall be added soon.

# contributing
The point of this repo is for people to contribute. Add fitting quotes to a file of your choosing or create an own. Add source when fitting. Fortune is meant to print "a random, hopefully interesting, adage" - (adage := a proverb or short statement expressing a general truth.)

Let's see what abstruse subtopics the internet will find. All topics should have an own file named [directory]-topic.
Quotes are seperated by %.
